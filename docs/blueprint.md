## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Royal Blue (#1C1D58) to convey trust and professionalism, aligning with the brand's logo and creating a strong visual anchor.
- Background color: A very light gray (#F0F0F0) to ensure a clean, minimalist aesthetic that enhances readability and emphasizes the content.
- Accent color: Warm Taupe (#BCB4A4) to provide subtle highlights and visual interest without detracting from the overall professional feel. Use this to give UI elements definition.
- Use Times New Roman for headings to convey authority and tradition.  A modern sans-serif for UI like forms
- Implement a clean layout with generous whitespace to promote readability and a professional aesthetic.
- Incorporate elegant, subtle animations such as scroll-based reveals, button hover states, and section fade-ins to enhance user engagement without overwhelming the user experience.
